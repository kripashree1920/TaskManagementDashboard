Self-Evaluation Document


Summary

The Task Management Dashboard is a client-side React application designed as a Kanban board to manage tasks across three columns: "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Built with react-beautiful-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality and json-server for mock API integration, the app allows users to view tasks, add new tasks via a modal form, and move tasks between columns. The UI features a visually striking radial gradient background in a purple combination, distinct column colors, and white task cards with box shadows, creating a modern and user-friendly experience. This self-evaluation assesses the project's functionality, aesthetics, technical quality, compliance with requirements, strengths, opportunities for enhancement, and insights gained.

Self-Criticism
The code is functional but has shortcomings:

Error Handling: The app logs errors but doesn't display user-friendly error messages.
Accessibility: The drag-and-drop feature lacks keyboard support, limiting accessibility.
Performance: Fetching all tasks on every status update could be optimized with caching.
Code Duplication: Some CSS styles could be refactored for maintainability.
Testing: No unit tests or end-to-end tests, which could ensure robustness.
Validation for form inputs (e.g., preventing empty titles) is minimal.
Lacking type checking.

Improvements
With more time, I would:

Add task editing and deletion features.
Implement user-friendly error notifications (e.g., toast messages).
Enhance accessibility with keyboard support and ARIA attributes.
Optimize API calls with debouncing or caching.
Add animations for task movements and modal transitions.
Write unit tests for components and API interactions.


Technology Rating:

React: 8/10 (Proficient in component-based architecture but could improve with hooks optimization).
JavaScript: 8/10 (Comfortable with ES6+ but need more async pattern experience).
CSS: 7/10 (Able to create responsive designs but could refine complex layouts).
react-beautiful-dnd: 6/10 (Implemented core functionality but limited advanced feature experience).
json-server: 7/10 (Set up mock API effectively but could explore advanced configurations).
